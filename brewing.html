            <br><dd><ol type="a"><br><li class="brewing-list">There are thousands of tea varieties, but they can all more or less be put into one of five categories:<br> white, green, oolong, black or dark (pu-erh from China’s Yunnan Province being the dominant dark).<br> 
                <br>The big difference between them is the degree to which the tea leaves are oxidized during processing.<br> Generally, the more that’s done to the leaves, the darker the tea.

                <br>
            <li class="brewing-list">Once you've chosen your tea, measure it out. The perfect tea-to-water ratio is personal—<br>some people prefer stronger teas, some prefer them light.
            <br><br>So you're going to want to experiment.<br> But a good starting point is one teaspoon of loose tea per cup of water.

        <dd><ol type="a"><br><li class="brewing-list"> Like the amount of tea you use, the time you spend steeping will come down to personal preference.<br><span class="special">(You're a beautiful, unique snowflake—and so is your cup of tea.)</span> </li> <br>
            <li class="brewing-list">Herbal infusions need the most steeping (5 to 7 minutes);<br> white teas need the least (just a minute or two). <br>For every other tea (black, green, oolong, dark), you can probably get away with 3 minutes.</li> <br>
            <li class="brewing-list">Taste the tea at this point—if you want it stronger, keep steeping! But don't just let the tea hang out in the mug/pot forever,<br> otherwise it will get tannic and bitter.</li></ol></dd>

        <dd><ol type="a"><br><li class="brewing-list">This sounds obvious, right? But this is about more than just temperature. <br>Letting the tea cool slightly before you start drinking it will allow you to taste the tea's subtle and delicate flavors.
            <br> And sure, it will also prevent you from burning your mouth.</li></ol></dd>
